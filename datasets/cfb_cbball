"I have seen several times during all the re-alignment talk that conferences care about research budgets, grants etc.  which is why schools like Vanderbilt/Rice/Wake Forest are more desirable than they seem. And that B1G is doing well from research perspective. 

Also mentioned is that research budgets dwarf athletic budgets (true). 

I tried googling it, but came up empty. How do research budgets impact decision making at the athletic conference level? Why do they matter if a school plays in a certain conference?

"Alright alright I know it’s never going to happen because of money, but I feel like this would be a great way to structure CFB.

The Super League failed in Europe because of all the backlash. Fans hated it, because of the deep social connections to their clubs. 

There are very deep connections to CFB because of, well, alumni. This makes CFB so fun to watch, even if you’re not a huge sports fan.

So, the idea of a multi-tiered league of football teams, one where teams can improve and created cinderalla runs (see Leicester City) would be great in the sport.

"He was already not with the team and sustained an injury during camp. He transferred in from Illinois State (FCS) last year. and after COVID and injuries decimated our secondary, he started as emergency safety despite being a CB.

He was probably the worst starting VT safety I have ever seen, but props to him for stepping up in an uncomfortable situation, and I wish him the best.

"Yes its a mess right now as rules and boundaries get properly defined but I love the idea that a kid doesn't have to make it in the NFL to be able to cash in on his football talent. Like looking at JT Daniel's, who knows if he makes it in the NFL, .. I was sure Aaron Murray would've made it (on topic of UGA qbs) but he didn't 
..but NIL makes that much less of an ultra-neccessary goal.

"So Roderick Daniels Jr. and Roderick Roberson Jr. both wear #13 for SMU.

Any other number doubles that have either the same first name or the same last name (or hell, identical names). And if there are any last name doubles, are they unrelated? Bonus points if they're not.

"Rutgers has SHI Stadium, formerly High Point Solutions Stadium, formerly Rutgers Stadium. Its unofficial nickname is “The Birth of College Football.” I always thought this was…kinda corny! Kind of like how Caldwell, NJ’s only defining landmark is that its the birthplace of Grover Cleveland. 

*However,* I’ve always been partial to Penn State’s Beaver Stadium (which i definitely never mistook for Oregon State’s stadium) often called Happy Valley. Also shout out to SCar’s Williams-Brice Stadium being called The Cock Pit.

There’s probably a 96% chance this will be deleted and I’m sorry mods. But since I was a senior in highschool I’ve been trying to watch SEC Network’s “Homecoming” episode about Hootie and the Blowfish. I just got ESPN+ and they don’t seem to have it :(. I am now a junior at FSU and slowly becoming more of an ACC fan. Hootie and the Blowfish are my second favorite band. I called customer service and they didn’t seem to help. Im a little drunk so trying to figure it out is kinda hard. But you gotta remember that I’ve been trying to do this since my senior year of HS. It’s the off-season please cut me some slack. I’ve endured enough as an FSU student my past two years lol.,1,I love CFB. I need help with ESPN + I’ve exhausted all other outlets,I love CFB.

Change my mind. College football would be better off with a large number of 10 team conferences that are regionally based. Every conference now has lost its old and historic geographic footprint. You play everybody else once for a 9 game round robin conference schedule. This way you preserve rivalries and play the games people want to see. It is not a conference if you don’t play other teams for years like the SEC where teams go 10 years without playing each other,1,CFB would be better with a bunch of 10 team conferences,CFB would be better with a bunch of 10 team conferences Change my mind.

"So it is always possible that a player slips through the cracks and does’t get recruited at top programs and goes to get developed i.e. Corey Davis being a notable example. 

Wondering if any of these players will now ever finish their careers at a program that finds them.

I assume starting as a freshman also becomes doubly important, because that way you can get recruited pretty quickly.

Wondering if any of these players will now ever finish their careers at a program that finds them.   With the way transfer rules are, why would a Corey Davis type of player ever stay at a CMUtype of school and not just move to AL LSU etc type of school and get paid?  I assume starting as a freshman also becomes doubly important, because that way you can get recruited pretty quickly.

"***The Kansas Showdown***

In this series, I will be conducting a simulation to see who is the best (or in some cases luckiest) team in each state. Each state will have a simulated tournament to see who comes out on top, and each state champion will punch their ticket to the final country-wide tournament, which will happen at some point before the actual CBB season starts. I will be conducting sims for each state alphabetically. The next state up is Kansas!

The teams will be seeded based on the final NET rankings from 2020-2021 and will battle it out in a single-elimination tournament. Here is how Kansas's seeding breaks down.

1. Kansas (NET 17)
2. Wichita St. (NET 70)
3. Kansas St. (NET 176)

&amp;#x200B;

***The Bracket***

There are 3 D1 teams in Kansas that participated in the 2020-2021 season. the bottom 2 seeds will play to see who will play the top seed in the title game.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Results***

\-*Round 1-*

2 Wichita St. (73) **3 Kansas St. (80)**

Rudi Williams goes off for 22/3/3 on 71.4% shooting as the Wildcats pull off the upset of the Shockers. Tyson Etienne's 20/5/2 isn't enough to propel Wichita St. to victory.

&amp;#x200B;

\-*Final Round-*

**1 Kansas (73)** 3 Kansas St. (60)

5 Jayhawks get into double figures with Marcus Garrett leading the way (16/7/4) as Kansas comfortable wins the *Kansas Showdown.* Nijel Pack is the only Wildcat to get into double figures as KSU falls flat.

"***The Delaware Showdown***

In this series, I will be conducting a simulation to see who is the best (or in some cases luckiest) team in each state. Each state will have a simulated tournament to see who comes out on top, and each state champion will punch their ticket to the final country-wide tournament, which will happen at some point before the actual CBB season starts. I will be conducting sims for each state alphabetically, and the next state up is Connecticut!

A quick note: Yale will be omitted because they did not participate in this past season.

The teams will be seeded based on the final NET rankings from 2020-2021 and will battle it out in a single-elimination tournament. Here is how Delaware's seeding breaks down.

1. Delaware (NET 220)
2. Delaware St. (NET 341)

&amp;#x200B;

***The Bracket***

This one will be super easy. Just 2 teams. Pretty evident how the bracket will play out.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Results***

\-*Final Round-*

1 Delaware (65) 2 Delaware St. (59)

Dylan Painter drops a double-double (13/12/1) and Ryan Allen scores 24 points as Delaware stifles bitter rival Delaware St. despite a strong effort from Zach Kent (16/6/5). The Hornets shoot sub 30% from the field as they are unable to battle back against their in-state rivals. Delaware wins the *Delaware Showdown.*

"I am shocked at the money being offered and for the type of recruits

Bryce Griggs ranked #43 in the country according to 247 Sports reportedly got 1.2 million

Nick Smith Jr who is a higher ranked at #25 reportedly only got 2 years 500k

Ernest Udeh who is ranked #53 has received an offer worth 1.2 million.

There is no way these are the actual salary values of the contracts correct? I am shocked at the amount of money being given out to this level of recruits.

I have no idea what OTE’s gameplan is but they have given out a shitton of money in the last couple months

Can anyone tell me how they normally do tickets for the early rounds?  I’m assuming there will be 4 games on Thursday and 2 on Saturday for each venue that first weekend(or Friday/Sunday for half of the venues). Are they all sold as individual game tickets, or are they sold in 2 game sessions??  

And how good of seats are available for sale to the general public?

"With more realignment probably just right around the corner let’s look at what I feel is the most likely outcome from a Conference Ranking perspective. For the sake of argument let’s pretend the conferences I say are absolute and all it plays out.

SEC: Adds OU and Texas (done deal)

B12: Backfills and Adds Cincy, Houston, Memphis, UCF, BYU, and USF

"Hello!

I am a graduate student from Colorado State University who is hoping to recruit participants for my research study regarding previous college student-athletes. This study will examine the impact of emotionally abusive coaching practices on former female athletes who competed in collegiate sport 1-5 years ago. The purpose of this study will be to understand the impact of emotional abuse on mental well-being, athletic performance, and a variety of other domains. If you are interested in participating in this study, you will be required to fill out a brief recruitment survey and then complete a qualitative interview which is estimated to last between 30 minutes and 2 hours. Although there may be no direct benefits, our hope is that research in this area could bring light to the often exploitative nature of college sport and help lay the groundwork for future research that could create safeguards for NCAA student-athletes. If you are interested in learning more or participating in this study, please send me a direct message on Reddit.

Thank you!

" Holy shit, I just found out that Donald Trump's kid, Barron Trump, is 6'7 and only 15 years old. With Donald Trump's money, they could put this kid in a top level prep school, and turn him into a legitimate Division 1 basketball player. If Barron Trump has a good work ethic, then he might have a chance to be a great basketball player. Keep in mind that the kid is only 15, so that means he's not done growing, which means that Barron Trump could end up being near 7' when he's done growing. Does anyone know if this kid plays basketball or any other sports at the moment? Does anyone know if he's athletic or if he's just a clumsy tall kid with no control over his body? Either way, I'm sure he could improve his athleticism, coordination, and quickness if he works at it. Whether you agree with Donald's policies or not, I think it would be cool to have a president's son become a high level basketball player, and if he ends up being around 7', works on some basketball skills, and isn't too slow and unathletic, then he could be a pro basketball player somewhere. **This is not meant to be a political post.**",0,"Barron Trump (Son of 45th U.S. President, Donald Trump)","Barron Trump (Son of 45th U.S. President, Donald Trump)  Holy shit, I just found out that Donald Trump's kid, Barron Trump, is 6'7 and only 15 years old.

Gets two AAU members to the Big Ten. Also, renews the KU/MU rivalry. Makes geographic sense (if that even matters anymore).

"Starting with the legendary 1992 Dream Team, the Olympics were finally opened up to NBA players. As a historical nod to how previous teams were formed, the '92 team included Christian Laettner on the roster despite there being NBA players that were clearly better at the time. There have actually been 2 other college players on USA Olympic teams since the, but what if every team had to include one? 

My rules were pretty simple. All 3 college players that have been on Team USA since '92 were lottery picks in the draft that year as well. They were also all 1st team All-Americans. Those were pretty good limitations, as the options for any given year are only a handful of players. With that in mind, here were my picks:

|Year|College Player|Player Removed|
--:|:--|:--|
|1992|Christian Laettner|NA|
|1996|Allen Iverson|Gary Payton|
|2000|Marcus Fizer|Antonio McDyess|
|2004|Emeka Okafor|NA|
|2008|Michael Beasley|Jason Kidd|
|2012|Anthony Davis|NA|
|2016|Buddy Hield|Harrison Barnes|
|2021|Cade Cunningham|Jerami Grant|

There were some players that just missed for different reasons. Kenyon Martin would have been my pick in 2000, but he broke his leg in March of that year. If there was an Olympic team in 2001, Shane Battier would have been the easy choice. I also considered Derrick Rose for 2008.But he was pretty much a 3rd team All-American that year, and although he had a great tournament run with Memphis and a better NBA career, I think Beasley was considered the better player at the time of the Olympics.",0,"If Team USA had to include a college player for every Olympics, who would have been that player for each team?","If Team USA had to include a college player for every Olympics, who would have been that player for each team?

"Months ago when the CBB getting was good I had a thought about how irked I get when TV Teddy is officiating, and how it's synergistically worse when the game is on ESPN, and soured even more when Dicky V is commentating.

So here's the premise: What is the most annoying possible total CBB game package?  1) Network  2) Venue  3) Matchup  4) Offical(s)  5) Commentator(s)  6) *Extra Credit* Shitty commercial that somehow afforded two plays on every commercial break",683,110,"most unwatch cbb game ? month ago when the cbb get wa good i had a thought about how irk i get when tv teddi is offici , and how it 's synergist wors when the game is on espn , and sour even more when dicki v is comment . i then began think about the awkward camera angl at the carrier dome ( no offens , cuse bro ) , the weird eye sore court pepper throughout the nation , the slow pace team and so on . so here 's the premis : what is the most annoy possibl total cbb game packag ? 1 ) network 2 ) venu 3 ) matchup 4 ) offic ( s ) 5 ) comment ( s ) 6 ) * extra credit * shitti commerci that somehow afford two play on everi commerci break"

"Seeing the kids play at a high level and with pace, it's been an entertaining tourney the last few days.

I think the wider lane would help a little bit with spacing inside and to open up offenses a bit, particularly with drives to the hoop.

Also, the shot clock is what every high level competition globally is doing. It's what is used in Canada's college level. 30 is better than 35 in terms of pace but seeing the Canadian and American kids handle the pace of 24 second possessions, I don't think moving it is a detriment to the game.

I know moving to halves might be a bridge too far given TV concerns but I don't think the shot clock or lane width would be huge jumps for the game.",0,Watching the FIBA U-19 tourney - I think it's time for a 24 second shot clock and a wider lane in the NCAA,"Watching the FIBA U19 tourney  I think it's time for a 24 second shot clock and a wider lane in the NCAA Seeing the kids play at a high level and with pace, it's been an entertaining tourney the last few days.

I said Pitt-WVU, but he said that shouldn't really count because they used to share a conference and if you consider Pitt a ""State U"", which is arguable, then it's a border rivalry.

He said UNC-Kentucky, but I said that shouldn't really count because, well, *everyone* who isn't a UK or UNC fan hates those schools and wants them to lose every game. Plus Kentucky used to be part of Virginia, and Virginia and North Carolina share a border.

"Hey all! with 125 days remaining until the start of the 21-22 season, I am wondering what mid-major programs you guys are excited about for the upcoming season?

I am personally excited about Colorado State (with a bit of bias I must confess). They are carrying a bit of momentum from last season and return all 5 starters, as well as D2 All-American Chandler Jacobs. I think they have a good shot at the MW title next season or at the very least top 3 and I think they will make a strong push and make the tourney as an 8-11 seed.

I am also really excited to see what Patrick Baldwin Jr will do at Milwaukee. He has so much talent and it will be really cool to see some attention brought to a program that usually doesn't receive it.

"Good morning /r/CollegeBasketball!

It's a new day in college athletics. What began as a long and slow process to allow college athletes to profit off the use of their Name, Image, and Likeness rapidly evolved over the last few months from changes in state laws and the recent Supreme Court decision.

Beginning today, the NCAA has implemented an interim policy suspending the eligibility rules surrounding NIL while working with Congress to develop a national standard.

We're expecting boatloads of major bag alerts from players and schools over the coming days. We ask that those announcements be posted in the megathread, while anything that is nationally newsworthy can still have it's own post.

Thanks everyone and happy NIL Day!

"Since the NBA changed their draft eligibility rules in 2006 college basketball has been ruled by the one-and-done stars. From Kevin Durant to Zion Williamson, the sport has become enraptured with players who are essentially biding their time waiting for their opportunity for a paycheck. I don't think anyone is going to claim that a player like KD or Zion would have stayed in college for longer if they were getting paid, but there's a whole other class of player that I think will weigh that decision very differently. 

Examine a player like Dayton's Obi Toppin. He burst onto the scene as a freshman and quickly ascended to stardom. The loss of the 2020 Tournament will forever remain the great what-if for Dayton fans, but what if Toppin could have cashed in on his NPOY season and stayed in college another season or two? Would be be talking about Dayton's Final Four run in the 2021 Tournament? Maybe that's worth more to him than being drafted eighth overall by the Knicks. 

NIL presents an option for star college players to stay in college without having to choose between millions of dollars and absolutely nothing. Sure, one-and-done isn't going away unless the NBA changes their rules, but I do think that giving players the option to cash in on college stardom may incentivize longer stints at the college level.

"There have been many discussions about which schools are blue bloods and which are in the next tier of historical greatness. People discuss whether teams can attain that status and then lose it. We're not here for that though. Which teams have been historically bad?

My first instinct was to nominate DePaul but I looked up their history and they've been to the NCAA tournament 22 times and have two final four appearances, though the last one of those was in 1979 before the modern tournament format. They also won the NIT in 1945. In recent memory though, they've been a perennial bottom dweller in the Big East.

Northwestern is probably a safer bet in a historical context. Despite being in a major conference, they've only made the NCAA tournament once, in 2017.

"As many of you know Army is one of the only four original D1 teams to have *never* made the NCAA tournament despite being led at different points in history by **Bob Knight** and **Mike Krzyzewski**. With so many people looking back at Coach K's career since he announced his retirement, I was wondering how well he could have done if he stayed at Army instead of taking the Duke job.

Obviously service academies aren't for everyone, and many 18 year olds wouldn't want to commit to years of military service after college. That, combined with the rigorous admissions standards at West Point, would make recruiting difficult, but I think Coach K would be able to make up for a lot of that with his coaching acumen. 

The *best* season he had at Army, he led them to a **19-9 record and an NIT berth**.

"With the news that Jon Scheyer will be Duke’s next coach, a lot of folks are missing /forgetting how good he was as a player.  His senior season was quietly one of college basketball’s greatest ever (statistically). 

He averaged 18.2 points, 3.9 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.6 steals, and only 1.6 turnovers and 1.4 fouls per game.  His overall fg percentage was not great (40%) but he shot 38% from three (on 7 attempts per game) and 88% from the FT line. 

Bart Torvik’s total player efficiency rating (Porpagatu!) has Scheyer’s senior season as the very best in his database (since 2008), and it’s not even close.  His 7.4 rating dwarfs the next two, the junior season of James Anderson (6.5) and Jimmer Fredette (6.3).  

His 9.7 win shares is 19th all time in the Sports Reference database (going back to 1996), one spot ahead of 2011 Kemba Walker and 2009 Blake Griffin.  

Sure, these advance stats only go back a few decades, but it’s still remarkable that he had one of the most effective seasons over a 20+ year stretch, yet folks don’t remember it that way.

"Hello! I wanted to fill you all in on a project that has been happening behind the scenes and is now ready to be unveiled.

A month ago, two dozen users from /r/collegebasketball and a few other college sports subreddits came together to create a university from scratch. This involved selecting a city, university name, color scheme, athletic nickname, and much more. We are now ready to unveil the university and open it up to more creative minds to truly help it come to life.

"I know college football is a completely different sport, but Oregon and Oklahoma St improved considerably in the last couple of decades with support from Phil Knight and T Boone Pickens, billionaires who love their school. 

With Gonzaga, it’s been finding pretty much the perfect coach and coaching staff over the long term. Along with building on tournament success and solid recruiting. Although I do believe they will win a national championship soon, they are definitely nationally relevant every year, and a legitimate title contender. 

With the right support, and massive investments, both financially and on the coaching and recruiting side of things, can any team be turned into a title contender? 

Let’s say someone wanted to donate $2 billion to be spent over the next 20 years, in the hope of seeing their alma mater win a title during their lifetime.

"The other day some of my college buddies and I were chatting about who the best player in our school's history was (we went to Texas A&amp;M). A few us tried to claim it had been Acie Law IV, but a couple of the others asserted that it had to have been Khris Middleton considering what he's doing in the NBA now. After talking about it for a bit, we ultimately decided that while Acie Law IV may not have been the ""best"" player in A&amp;M's history, he's probably the *most important* considering how he left a positive impact on our program for at least another 7-8 years. This got me to thinking; what are some other stark examples of program's which have a ""best player"" that is drastically different than ""most important player""? Is this the case for whatever team you're a fan of?

Other examples I can think of the top of my head:

**Oklahoma:** Best player: Blake Griffin

Most important: Wayman Tisdale

**UConn:** Best player: Ray Allen

Most important: Kemba

**UNC:** Best player: Tyler Hansbrough 

Most important: MJ

"What I mean by tamper, is that coaches contact players on other teams during the season/when they have not put their name in the transfer portal.

On one hand, you can't just tell coaches and players to just cut ties and not to talk to people that they have probably recruited for the last couple of years.

However, as a coach, you should be focused on your team there now and not just immediately focus on next year's team as soon as your current season is going on the wrong direction. That's not fair to the athletes there.

I think the big issue is that they just need to add a dead period for the transfer portal because it's basically free agency at this point, so just treat it like that.

"There was a discussion being had in another thread and I decided to look into the performance in the conference for teams in the Atlantic 10.


Best A10 average records for A10 conference games played in the last 10 years:

Team | Average wins | average losses

VCU | 12.2 | 5
Dayton | 11.6| 5.6

UMass | 7.1 | 9.5
George Mason | 7 | 10.4
Duquesne | 6.3 | 10.7
Fordham | 3.8 | 13.1


Note: Conference went from 16 games to 18 games in this time and the Covid Season resulted in different numbers of games for teams.



Points that stood out to me:

- There seems to be a clear divide between the top half of the conference and the bottom half of the conference.
- A lot of people talk about LaSalle being outmatched in the A10 but none of the teams other than Fordham below them have the same thing said about them.

"I am a KU fan, and apparently we are sitting in pretty good shape to possibly land him as a transfer. Admittedly, I did not watch a ton of Georgia games this year. What I did watch was not pretty.

His numbers from last season aren’t very good outside of his counting stats (ppg and assist). He was wildly inefficient and turned the ball over a significant amount.

Yet, when I look for information on twitter, the opinions on him are generally positive? So my question for someone who watched him is: what’s the deal with the stats?

"Everyone loves a good redemption storyline; a team loses a heartbreaking game, uses the loss as motivation, and then triumphs the next time out. I'm curious how many National Championships could be counted as redemption stories? 

I admittedly wear ACC tinted glasses, so the ones that come to mind for me are

1. UVa being the first #1 seed ever to lose to a 16 seed in '18, then coming back to win in '19.
2. UNC losing to Nova in the championship game in '16, then coming back to win it all in '17.
3. Duke getting blown out by UNLV in '90, to come back to win in '91.

So obviously any non-champion team lost the prior season, so I wouldn't consider just a loss as heartbreak. In my mind it would be losing on a buzzer beater, suffering a huge upset, or losing in the final four/championship game (There could be others).

"Might as well continue the KenPom trend, so here’s the pre-tourney/post-tourney Adjusted Defensive Efficiency ranking for every champion (2002-2021):

-Ranked 11-20: 4/19 champs

-Ranked 21-30: 3/19 champs 

-Ranked 31-above: 4/19 champs


-Biggest jump: 2015 Duke (37 to 11)


-15/19 champions have been in the top 30 of AdjD rankings entering the tournament. The exceptions:

2003 Syracuse (31)

2009 UNC (37)

2015 Duke (37)

2020 Baylor (44)



Moral of the story: when picking a champion in your bracket, it’s obviously still pretty smart to go with a team in the arbitrary top 30 of AdjD—-and if you go with a team outside that group, make sure you have legitimate reason to believe they will improve during the tourney (i.e. 2009 UNC brought back the entire core of a team that was a top 15 defensive unit the year before—it was easy to assume they hadn’t completely turned up the defensive intensity yet; 2021 Baylor was a top 3 unit before their Covid hiatus).

"Curious to get everyone's takes on this. I've been reading a lot about the CCNY and BC point shaving scandals back in the day, and it has me wondering if this stuff still goes on today. From my research, the last documented point shaving scandal was at San Diego during the 09-10 season, and before that, at Toledo from 2003 to 2006. So its roughly been a decade since the last scandal.

I don't think it happens as frequently anymore because:

1.) The mob was a big force behind the older point shaving scandals, and they've been all but eradicated.

2.) Players get paid millions in the pros nowadays, much more than they made in the 50s-early 70s. Most players aren't going to take a few thousand to point shave if they think they have a shot at the league. This is also why I think it happens at mid major schools more often as of late.

3.) The NCAA and the feds have cracked down on it, the people behind the schemes have gotten upwards of 10 years in prison, players participating have gotten a year behind bars. With sports betting becoming legalized across the nation, more resources have been devoted to monitoring for wrongdoing.
